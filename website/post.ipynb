    "52 million mothers in the United States live with their children.\n",
    "Of those, over 4.5 million are in poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "That poverty rate of 9.0 percent is a bit lower than the overall poverty rate of 9.3 percent,[^spm] largely thanks to safety net programs that target families with children.\n",
    "Yet, many of those programs fail to reach low-income mothers due to qualification rules and complex bureaucracies.\n",
    "For example, [70 percent of single moms do not receive the full Child Tax Credit](https://tcf.org/content/report/what-a-child-allowance-like-canadas-would-do-for-child-poverty-in-america/?session=1).\n",

    "[^spm]: This analysis uses the 2020 Current Population Survey March Supplement, and the [Supplemental Poverty Measure](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-275.html).\n",
    "The official SPM poverty rate was 9.1 percent in 2020, but the public use microdata that powers our analysis produces slightly different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler alternative, which [other countries adopt](https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/policies.html#other-countries) and [which we've written about in several other reports](https://www.ubicenter.org/tag/child-allowance/), is a universal child allowance: a flat amount given each month to parents for each of their children.\n",
    "\n",
    "While child allowances chiefly reduce child poverty, they also lift mothers out of poverty.\n",
    "For example, a \\$200 per month child allowance would lift one million mothers out of poverty, at an annual cost of \\$173 billion.[^funding]\n",
    "\n",
    "[^funding]: This static analysis assumes no funding and no behavioral responses.\n",
    "It uses the open source [OpenFisca US](https://openfisca.us) microsimulation model from [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org)."
